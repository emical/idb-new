## How to comment on Islamic Dream Book

We welcome thoughtful and civilized discussion. The Islamic Dream Book editorial team reserves the right to edit or delete comments as we see fit, without explanation.

Here’s what your comment should look like:

- Use your real first name and email address in the comment form
- Add smart, relevant ideas that expand on an article’s premise — read the article before you comment
- Drop funny references or jokes that carry the conversation forward
- Offer useful, constructive (not stupid or ugly) criticism
- Any combination of the above
Certain comments may not be posted or may be deleted after they are posted.

Here are some examples (not comprehensive, but you’ll get the idea) of types of comments that’ll ensure your failure to communicate, at least on Islamic Dream Book:

- You don’t use your real first name or email address
- There are keywords and/or your business name in the name field of the comment form
- Comments that demonstrate you didn’t read, watch, or listen to the content
- Comments that simply restate or repeat information from the article and don’t carry the conversation forward
- Off-topic personal or professional rants
- Threats to us or other visitors
- Any form of defamation
- Racist or obscene nastiness
- Violation of anyone’s copyright, trademark, etc.
- Promotions about and/or links back to your product, service, or latest venture
- Don’t contribute spam
- If you’d like your comment to appear on Islamic Dream Book, be respectful of our community and think before you post.


## And that’s it. Simple, right?
See you in the Islamic Dream Book comments!
