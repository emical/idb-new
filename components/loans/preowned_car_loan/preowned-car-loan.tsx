          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Advance EMI scheme</strong> &ndash; Under this scheme, you pay interest and EMI at the start of the
            month. So, each month, you pay interest on amount that you have already repaid to the bank at the beginning

          <li>
            Imp <strong>Note</strong> &ndash; In case your bank charges EMI in advance, the EMI amount should be about

            free lunches scheme that really doesn&rsquo;t exist. So, watch out for schemes that claim to supply zero
            interest. It is likely that the car company is offering a subvention scheme whereby the interest is paid by
            it to the bank upfront. Now, you'll always ask the dealer for an equivalent amount as a cash discount.

            <strong> Flat rate of interest scheme</strong> &ndash; during this method, you pay interest on the whole

            <strong>Reducing balance scheme</strong> - during this method, you pay interest on the quantity outstanding
            monthly . as you pay EMI, the balance principal amount keeps reducing. So, on a Rs. 5 lakh loan at 10% for

            Rs. 1,37,411 or Rs. 6,37,411 including principal. The EMI in this case would be Rs. 10,624, an honest 15%
            but that for a flat rate scheme.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Very Important Note</strong> &ndash; Never get hoodwinked with the low rate of interest offered on a
            flat rate scheme. A flat rate of 10% is adequate to an rate of interest of 18.7% on reducing rate basis on a
            5 year {bankName} Pre owned car loan .

          EMI = Units of currency 10,000,000 * 0.00875 * (1 + 0.00875)^120 / ((1 + 0.00875)^120 &ndash; 1) = Units of
          currency 134,935. i.e., you'll need to pay total currency units 134,935 for 120 months to repay the whole loan
          amount. the entire amount payable are going to be 134,935 * 120 = 16,192,200 currency units that has currency
